# **Restaurant API**

## **Description**
The Restaurant API is a Django-based backend application designed to manage a restaurant's operations. It supports three types of users: **Manager**, **Delivery Crew**, and **Customer**. Each user type has specific roles and permissions:

- **Manager**:
  - Add, edit, and delete menu items.
  - View all users, orders, and delivery crew members.
  - Assign orders to  a delivery .
  - Update the delivery of orders .
- **Customer**:
  - View the menu and categories.
  - Add items to their cart and place orders.
  - View their order history and search for menu items by name or category.
- **Delivery Crew**:
  - View and update the status of assigned orders.

This API uses session-based authentication, and users are activated immediately after signing up. The API is fully documented using Swagger for easy testing and integration.

The frontend for this project (built with Flutter) can be found here: [Master Chef Flutter-Django](https://github.com/HadiAlhamed/Master-chef-flutter-django).

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.12
- Pipenv (Install it globally if not already installed: `pip install pipenv`)

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lamaDayoub/django-LittleLemon
   cd LittleLemon
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies with Pipenv**:
   Use Pipenv to create a virtual environment and install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pipenv install django
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   Activate the virtual environment created by Pipenv:
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

4. **Run Migrations**:
   Apply database migrations to set up the SQLite database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**:
   To access the admin panel, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:
   Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

## **API Documentation**
All API endpoints are documented using Swagger. To explore the API:
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. Navigate to the Swagger interface at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/
   ```
3. Use the interactive interface to test endpoints and view detailed documentation.

## **Frontend Integration**
The frontend for this project is built using Flutter and can be found at the following repository:
[Master Chef Flutter-Django](https://github.com/HadiAlhamed/Master-chef-flutter-django)

To integrate the frontend with the backend:
1. Clone the Flutter repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiAlhamed/Master-chef-flutter-django.git
   ```
2. Update the API base URL in the Flutter app to point to your Django backend (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`).
3. Run the Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

---

## **Future Improvements**
- **Token Authentication**: Replace session-based authentication with token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for better scalability.

- **Notifications**: Implement real-time notifications for order updates (e.g., using WebSockets).
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for production use.
